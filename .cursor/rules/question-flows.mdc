The question flow is like this: 

The user input is saved as last_utterance -> optimize question(optimizeSemantic)-> cutstom_embeddings -> analysis prompt -> 

one of four alternatives: 
1. extractStandard -> qo_filter.py 
2. extractFromMemory -> qo_filter.py
2. optimizeTextual -> qo_textual.py
3. qo_personal.py

->

the queryObject will be sent to retriever -> retrieve chunks from elasticsearch -> answer prompt and output to the user.
